# bit

A fully git-compliant that currently implements a small subset of git
commands.

Wouldn't recommend using this to manipulate your valued repositories yet!

Currently implements the following commands with the a subset of the
same options as git.
- bit init,
- bit add,
- bit commit,
- bit hash-object,
- bit cat-file,
- bit log,
- bit ls-files,
- bit commit-tree,
- bit config,
- bit write-tree,
